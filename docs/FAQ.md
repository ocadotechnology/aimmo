## What is Code For Life?
- Ocado Technology's FREE Code for Life initiative has been developed to inspire the next generation of computer scientists and to help teachers deliver the computing curriculum.
This repository hosts the source code of the [**AI:MMO game**](https://www.codeforlife.education/play/aimmo/). AI:MMO is a follow-on from Rapid Router to teach computing to secondary-school age children.

- It's ***FREE*** forever!

- The other repos for Code For Life:
    - the main portal (as well as registration, dashboards, materials...), [Code For Life Portal](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/codeforlife-portal)
    - the first coding game of Code for Life for primary schools, [Rapid Router](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/rapid-router)
    - the [deployment code for Google App Engine](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/codeforlife-deploy-appengine)
        
## I have an issue with the project, who do I contact, what do I do?
The first step is to [**check the common/known issues**](common-issues.md) page to see if your issue is a common one and we know about
the solution. 

Next step is to make sure you have set up the project correctly as per our instructions.

Finally, you can contact the contributors and receive help by opening an issue in the project and tagging it
appropriately (perhaps `bug` or `help-wanted`).

## I want to contribute... How?

First read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/codeforlife-portal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), thanks!

Look for issues tagged with `help-wanted` to find some good starter issues you could start working on. If you need
to contact us, look at the contact details. Thank you!
