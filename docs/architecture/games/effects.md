# Effects

Effects are a component of an `Interactable`.

An effect should have at least one target.

When an Interactable's conditions are met, the targets are gathered, and the effects are then given to them. Targets for an effect must have a `effect` attribute with which to store its active effects.

An effect can last 1 or many turns, and can impart a temporary or permanent change to its target, for example: restoring some of an Avatar's health, or giving an avatar a temporary damage boost.
