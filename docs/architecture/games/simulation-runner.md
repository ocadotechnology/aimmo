# Simulation Runner

---



The [`SimulationRunner`](simulation-runner-file) is responsible 
for running a turn in the simulation. 

The `run_turn` method is called from `GameRunner`, and it 
runs as follows:

* Get the [`AvatarWrapper`'s](avatar-wrapper-file) to 
deserialize and register their actions. 
* Update the environment using the [World Map](world-map-doc)
* Check if the level is complete (the MMO will probably not 
finish - this is a somewhat deprecated feature) 

The alternatives for pooling each avatar for its decisions are:
* SequentialTurnManager (used locally for testing) - get and 
apply each avatar's action in turn 
* ConcurrentTurnManager - concurrently get the intended 
actions from all avatars and register them on the world map; 
then apply actions in order of priority
