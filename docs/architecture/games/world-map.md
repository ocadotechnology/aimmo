# World Map

---

The World Map is the central component of the simulation. The class itself consists of a grid and a set of JSON settings. The grid consists of a dictionary of type <Location, Cell>.

### Cells

A cell has the following components:
* location - (x, y) pairs that can be added together, serialized, compared, etc.
* avatars - see [Game Objects](game-objects) for more details
* pickup - see [Game Objects](game-objects) for more details
* cell content - the cell content can either be a score cell, an obstacle or a plain floor cell
* actions - an array where the intended actions of different avatars are registered and, afterwards, applied

### World Map basic functionality 

World Map has a lot of misc functionality, as multiple other objects communicate with it and need a simple API. 

Cell specific functionality:
* get_cell
* all_cells
* score_cells
* pickup_cells

Map dimension functionality:
* is_on_map
* max_x
* max_y
* min_x
* min_y
* num_cols
* num_rows
* num_cells

### The Update Cycle 

The most important responsibility of the world map class is the `self.update` after the intended character moves have been recorded by the Simulation Runner. The function `update` is called by the [Simulation Runner](simulation-runner). 

The update cycle is as follows:
* update avatars
   * apply score: each avatar received a score
   * apply pickups: each avatar grabs a pickup if present
* update map:
   * expand the map so that it fits the size of the avatars if more avatars arrive
   * reset score locations: new score locations are generated
   * add pickups: new pickups are generated

All the map updates are regulated using the settings of a map. Some useful settings fields are:
* TARGET_NUM_CELLS_PER_AVATAR - regulates the size of the map by number of avatars
* TARGET_NUM_SCORE_LOCATIONS_PER_AVATAR - used to regulate the number of score locations; the new score locations are generated randomly and added to the map
* SCORE_DESPAWN_CHANCE - another parameter to regulate the score cells generation; the game is more dynamic as some score cells are getting removed each turn and new ones are generated, giving the player the impressing of score cells moving around
* TARGET_NUM_PICKUPS_PER_AVATAR - regulate the number of pickups similarly to how the number of score locations are regulated
* PICKUP_SPAWN_CHANCE - a regulation parameter similar to SCORE_DESPAWN_CHANCE
