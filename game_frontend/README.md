# AI:MMO Frontend

## Description

This folder contains the frontend for the AI:MMO game. It is a single page application using [React](https://reactjs.org/). We use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management and [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) for handling our side effects (e.g. asynchronous calls). To learn more about how we connect all of these together, feel free to check out our [How does it all work](#how-does-it-all-work) section.

## Installation for Contributors

### Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

### Build dependencies

Once you have cloned this repository, run the command below in this folder:

```
yarn
```

## Usage

### Standalone

It's possible to run the frontend by itself. To do so, run the command below in this folder.

```
parcel index.html
```

### With Django

Our Django runner calls `djangoBundler.js` when running the project for you so nothing special needs to done! Run this command in the root of this repository (make sure you are in your virtualenv):

```
./run.py -k
```

`djangoBundler.js` is a custom `parcel-bundler` we use to make sure we generate a Django template as an entry point for the React code.

### Running Tests

```
yarn test
```
