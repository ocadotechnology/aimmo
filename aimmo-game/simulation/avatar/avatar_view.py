class AvatarView:
    """
    The custom view of the world for each of the avatars. The main
    use of this class is that when the view is moved, the game service
    knows which objects need to be created and which need to be deleted
    from the scene.

    Say the view is 4x4 cells. Cells 'in view' are marked with a 'V'.
                                 _ _ _ _
                               |V V V V V|
                               |V V V V V|
                               |V V V V V|
                               |V_V_V_V_V|
    Now suppose the user moves east. The idea is the following,
                            C C C_C_C_C_C C
                            C C|C V V V V|R
                            C C|C V V V V|R
                            C C|C V V V V|R
                            C C|C_V_V_V_V|R
                            C C C C C C C C
    where C stands for 'clear' and R for 'reveal'. This class calculates
    for every move action the cells to clear and the cells to reveal, and keeps
    track of the cells in view. This reduces the computations of how to change
    the view to only what's strictly necessary. Following with the example, after
    sending the game objects to create/delete in world_state, the new view would be
                                 _ _ _ _
                               |  V V V V|V
                               |  V V V V|V
                               |  V V V V|V
                               | _V_V_V_V|V
    where the original view is delimited by the | and the _.
