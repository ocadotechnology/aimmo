#  Worksheet 1 challenges:
#    Task 1: Change direction
#       - The starter code moves your avatar North. Change this code so that it
#         moves in a different direction.
#
#    Task 2: Move in all directions
#       - Write some code that moves your avatar in a random direction. Don't
#         forget to add `import random` at the top of your code.
#
#    Task 3: Investigate location
#       - Investigate what `print(avatar_state.location)` tells you and then
#         check if you can move to the next location
#
#  New commands:
#       - MoveAction(DIRECTION)
#       - avatar_state.location -> LOCATION
#       - world_state.can_move_to(LOCATION) -> True/False

#  Worksheet 2 challenges:
#    Task 1: Avoiding obstacles
#       - Change the code so that your avatar tries a different direction if
#         they are unable to move. To avoid repeating code, create a subroutine
#         called get_random_dir() and use it to return a random direction.
#
#    Task 2: Pick up an artefact
#       - Pick up any artefacts you find on the board. If the location you are
#         in contains an artefact, you can pick it up by returning a
#         PickupAction() instead of a MoveAction(DIRECTION).
#
#  New commands:
#       - action = PickupAction()

#  Worksheet 3 challenges:
#     Task 1: Direction control
#       - Return MoveTowardsAction(ARTEFACT) to move towards the nearest
#         artefact.
#       - You can use world_state.scan_nearby() to get a list of nearby
#         artefacts.
#       - You must check that the list is not empty before reading a value from
#         it.
#
#     Task 2: Pick up five artefacts
#       - Pick up five artefacts on the board. Check your backpack to see how
#         many you are holding using `avatar_state.backpack`. Output a message
#         when you have picked up five.
#
#     Task 3: Types of artefacts
#       - Part 1: Use `artefact.type` where `artefact` is an item of
#         `avatar_state.backpack` to list all types of artefacts in your
#         backpack.
#       - Part 2: Output a summary of your backpack using the same
