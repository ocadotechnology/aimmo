# AI:MMO
A **M**assively **M**ulti-player **O**nline game, where players create **A**rtificially **I**ntelligent programs to play on their behalf.

## Objective
People program Avatars. Avatars play the game. A player's aim is to create a better Avatar than other people's Avatars. A "better" Avatar is one that scores points faster than other people's Avatars.

By getting people to compete to program better Avatars, we can teach them all sorts of algorithms and optimisation techniques. For example, a really good Avatar might incorporate AI techniques such as neural networks in order to make more optimal decisions.
